# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `zsxq-fetch` in `cosmos-sources-tools`, with authenticated Chrome collection, fail-closed daily coverage, deterministic checkpointing and rendering, image/PDF content verification, and content-only Markdown output.
- Standalone `cosmos-sources-tools` plugin containing the `cls-fetch` complete current-day CLS retrieval and semantic-filtering skill.
- Marketplace, installation, runtime, and architecture documentation for `cosmos-sources-tools`.

### Changed

- Bumped `cosmos-sources-tools` to `0.2.1` for the fixed Beijing-date boundary contract.
- Expanded `cosmos-sources-tools` metadata and documentation to cover both bundled source-retrieval skills, and bumped the plugin version to `0.2.0`.

### Fixed

- Validate ZSXQ topic membership after strictly parsing explicit timestamp offsets and converting the represented instant to Beijing time instead of comparing the timestamp's textual date prefix.
