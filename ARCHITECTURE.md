# Architecture

## Purpose

This repository is the `cosmos-plugins` Codex marketplace. It packages reusable skills into independently installable plugins while keeping marketplace discovery metadata in the repository.

## Structure

- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`: Ordered marketplace catalog. Each entry points to one local plugin under `plugins/`.
- `plugins/cosmos-knowledge-tools/`: Knowledge-management and Obsidian workflows packaged together.
- `plugins/cosmos-sources-tools/`: Source-retrieval plugin providing CLS telegraph retrieval and semantic filtering plus authenticated Knowledge Planet daily archival.
  - `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: Plugin identity, discovery metadata, and skill path.
  - `skills/cls-fetch/`: Installable skill instructions, agent metadata, Node.js runtime scripts, and repair references.
  - `skills/zsxq-fetch/`: Installable skill instructions, agent metadata, browser collector, deterministic Node.js runner, image/PDF extraction resources, output templates, and repair references.
- `README.md`: Installation, available-plugin, runtime, and update guidance.

## Dependency flow

The marketplace manifest discovers each plugin through a relative `./plugins/<name>` path. Each plugin manifest then exposes its bundled `skills/` directory. The plugins do not depend on each other and can be installed separately.
